The note will then appear on the left side of the window with the rest of the notes. Any note can be edited by clicking on it, which will open it up in the right column again. To save your changes, click the save icon again. Any note can be deleted by clicking on the red trash can icon next to that note ('note 2' was deleted in the picture below).
